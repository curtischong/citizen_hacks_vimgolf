A letter from Curtis

Hello! I hope that youâ€™re having a blast meeting new people and working on your ideas at Citizen hacks!

While you type away on your laptops I thought that it would be cool to tell a story about the team and how we planned this event.

It began when we entered university.

const YEAR = 2018

let group = ['Marcel', 'Mio', 'Ben']

let add_member = (group, name) => {
  group.push(name);
  console.log(`Added ${name}`);
};

let add_members = (group, names) => {
  names.forEach((name) => {
    add_member(group, name);
  });
};

// assembling friends
let new_members = ['Daniel', 'Curtis', 'Michael']
add_members(group, new_members);


Several months passed.
